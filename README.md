# Spring Data Walk-through

Code that accompanies the Spring Data Postgres presentation.  Creates a simple web API using spring-boot, Jpa, and postgres that retrieves games and players.

### Database Connection
Prior to running the application, you'll need to update the application.yml with your current database settings.

### Running the Application
To run, right-click on AppRunner and select Run 'AppRunner.man'.  If the application starts correctly, it will create the Game and Player tables in your database and initialize them with records.
